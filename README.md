# Illinois-Mortgage-Acceptance

# Abstract

The objective of this project is to provide an independent study on the relationships between various factors of a property, mortgage application, and mortgage applicant to determine trends for successful home ownership in Illinois.

Every year, the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council requires institutions to report mortgage loan application and property data for a report mandated through the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act. 

As property costs continue to rise faster than wages, homeownership seems more like an American dream than an investment or a choice made with preferences.

To understand the factors of successful mortgage applications, the report uses natural language preprocessing, feature engineering, clustering, statistical analysis, and machine learning applications to develop significant conclusions and relationships between selected features.

Surprisingly, properties with a minority population percent between 15.37% and 34.41% had a 3.49% advantage over properties with a minority population greater than or equal to 34.41% and a 1.91% advantage over properties with a minority population less than or equal to 15.37%. Applicants who used a top 15 lender from 2020, ranked by loans issued, had a success rate of 94.27% compared to a 89.98% success rate for those who used a lender out of the top 15. Income played a large role, as expected. Incomes greater than or equal to $105K were over 9% more successful than incomes less than or equal to $62K. While one may assume that a larger loan is riskier to the lender which in turn would lead to rejections, the data says otherwise. Mortgage applications for properties valued over or equal to $325K had a 94.9% success rate compared to an 88.27% success rate for properties valued under or equal to $195K. This may not show the full picture, as loan to value seems to be another big factor. Loan to value less than or equal to 80% has a 95.05% success rate, almost 5% higher than a loan to value greater than or equal to 95%. Perhaps the 20% down payment not only saves on the monthly payments, but also increases mortgage application odds?

The goal of the study is to provide insights into correlated factors with successful mortgage applicants in Illinois. This is done through interpreting various features on the 2021 HDMA report, feature engineering fields, and analyzing stratas to determine statistically significant relationships.

# Introduction

Please use the Table of Contents, found below, to navigate the project!

In this project I explore mortgage application data sourced from the 2021 HDMA report. The data can be retrieved and partitioned by state through the FFIECâ€™s website under HDMA Data Publication. All data cleaning and engineering was performed in the Jupyter Notebook, uploaded in the repository.

The project is concluded with an Up Sampled (Oversample from the minority) Random Forest model, Down Sampled (Undersample from the majority) Random Forest model, SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) Random Forest model, and a regular Random Forest model that all have an objective to estimate if a particular applicant will be successful and receive a mortgage.

# Observations and Findings
- MSA-MD code 16984 Chicago-Naperville-Evanston has 57.18% of all applicants and is 1% more successful than the rest of the MSA-MD codes.
- Principal occupancy types have a .489% over Investment occupancy types, however, the P Value is 5.8%.
- High property values (>=$325K) have a 6.65% success advantage over low property values (<=$195K).
- A property with a tract population of over 4,054 are 2.77%-3.18% more likely to be successful than a property with a tract population <= 4,054.
- Properties in a medium (15.37% - 34.41%) minority population percentage tract had a 93.23% success rate, compared to 91.32% of those properties in a low (<=15.37%) minority population percentage tract.
- Income >= $106K had a 95.39% success rate compared to 86.22% of income <=$62K.
- Applicants that were not Hispanic, or Latino has a 92.26% success rate compared to an 89.78% success of the Hispanic, or Latino applicants.
- Asian applicants were 93.88% likely to get a mortgage, compared to a success rate of 93.15% for White applicants and 81.85% for Black applicants.
- Male applicants had an almost 2% advantage over female applicants.
- Age sweet spot seemed to be 25-44, as this group had a 2.1% advantage over the other age brackets.
- The top 15 lenders in 2020, by loan issuance, are the following in descending order: Homepoint, Guild Mortgage, Guaranteed Rate, Crosscountry Mortgage, Mr. Cooper, U.S. Bank, Bank of America, JP Morgan Chase, Fairway Independent Mortgage, Caliber Home Loans, loanDepot, Wells Fargo, Freedom Mortgage, United Wholesale Mortgage, and Rocket Mortgage.
- High loan amounts (>=$285K) had a 6.46% advantage over low loan amounts (<=$165K).
- Low loan to value mortgages (<=80%) had a 4.59% advantage over high loan to value mortgages.

# Model Evaluations

The outcome of the mortgage application is heavily imbalanced, 92.88% of all applications were successful.

The top performing classification model was the random forest model with an over sample of the minority, with a macro average F1 score of .93. Prediction of success had a F1 of .99 and prediction of rejection had a F1 of .87. The random forest model, without sampling techniques, performed quite well and had the same metrics as the over sample of the minority random forest model. Thus, extensive resampling may not be necessary for predicting the imbalanced loan outcome.
